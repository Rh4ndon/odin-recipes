        Most lasagna recipes call for hours of simmering the tomato/meat sauce to release its flavors. This one, however, only requires 5 minutes of simmering time.
    </p>
    <p>
        How is that possible, you ask? Well, its simple: all youll need is a marinara sauce. Since its already packed with flavor, theres no need to wait at all!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>Bulk Italian sausage or ground beef</li>
        <li>Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the lasagna noodles from heat after 4 minutes. They will continue to cook as they bake. This way, the noodles will be perfectly al dente.</li>
        <li>To stop the noodles from further cooking, transfer them into a colander and run them under cold water. </li>
        <li>Stop the noodles from sticking together by laying them in a single layer on a piece of parchment paper brushed with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Heres an alternative “cooking” method: soak the noodles in hot water for 30 minutes. Theyll be soft enough by then. </li>
        <li>Shred your own mozzarella for maximum melting potential.</li>
        <li>Use freshly grated parmesan cheese for optimum flavor. You want to use real parmesan, too, not the one from a can.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with marinara sauce before adding the lasagne noodles. Otherwise, the noodles will stick to the pan, and it will be tough to take them out when slicing. Be sure the bottom of the pan is well-coated!
        </li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before you slice and serve. If you slice it straight from the oven, the layers will slide apart as you cut. Give it time to set!</li>
        <li>Use a chefs knife to slice the lasagna into squares. Use a flexible spatula to transfer it from the pan to the plate. </li>
        <li>To reheat leftover lasagna, cover the pan with foil and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>To freeze leftover lasagna, wrap the pan in plastic wrap twice and once in foil. Transfer it to the fridge a day before use. Reheat at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Frozen lasagna lasts for up to 2-3 months.</li>
    </ol>
